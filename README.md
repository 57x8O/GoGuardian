# Help for config.json
BanCount: how much times a person/bot can ban in banseconds (see below) if they reach over x limit they get banned themselves
BanSeconds: if someone has banned equal to or over the BanCount (see above) in y seconds
Token: (your bot token duh?)
Whitelisted: Whitelisted IDs that can bypass the banning

# General help

don't forget to make the bot role the HIGHEST it can be (even above your admins) and give it audit log perms, ban perms
so basically just give it admin it's easier

#Anti-Nuke features

does very simple anti fake-bot checking (mee6,dyno)
bans the "wizz" bot very fast (GoRaider on my github got 3 before Anti-Nuke got it)
faster than higher-level languages like js,python etc

#Anti-Nuke cons
doesn't really have multi-guild support
