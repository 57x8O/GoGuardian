# GoGuardian ™️ the only way to truly protect your server against people like me


# General help

don't forget to make the bot role the HIGHEST it can be (even above your admins) and give it audit log perms, ban perms
so basically just give it admin it's easier


# Help for config.json

Threshold: how much times a person/bot can do a certain action in x seconds (see below) if they reach over x limit they get banned themselves

Seconds: if someone has banned equal to or over the Threshold (see above) in x seconds

token: (your bot token duh?)

WhitelistedIDs: Whitelisted IDs that can bypass the banning

# Anti-Nuke features

bans the "wizz" bot very fast (GoRaider on my github got 3 before Anti-Nuke got it)

faster than higher-level languages like js,python etc

covers all endpoints (except emojis) 

# Anti-Nuke cons

doesn't really have multi-guild support or sharding so no real scalability
